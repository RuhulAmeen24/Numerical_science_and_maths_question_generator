Force is a push or pull which changes or tries to change the state of rest
Linear momentum of a body is equal to the product of its mass and velocity
A body continues to be in its state of rest or in uniform motion along a straight line unless an external force is applied on it.
The rate of change of linear momentum is proportional to the applied force and change in momentum takes place in the direction of applied force.
For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and both acts on two different bodies
If no external force acts on a system, then its total linear momentum remains conserved.
It is a field force, the force with which a body is pulled towards the centre of the earth due to gravity.
Tension across a massless pulley or frictionless pulley remain constant.
