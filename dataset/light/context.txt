Light waves are electromagnetic waves.
The speed of light in vacuum is 3 x 10^8 mls but it is different in different media.
The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection.
An object at placed at a distance from a plane mirror, has image at same distance from mirror.
The number of images formed using two mirrors depends on the angle between them.
Focal length is half the length of the radius of the spherical mirror.
Radius length is twice the focal length of the spherical mirror.
The ratio of height of image formed by a mirror to the height of the object is called linear magnification.
The ratio of area of image to the area of object is called areal magnification.
The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant for a pair of two media.
The ratio of speed of light in vacuum (c) to the speed of light in any medium (u) is called refractive index of the medium
The reciprocal of the focal length of a lens is called power of lens.
Power of lens can be expressed as sum of individual powers.
The angle sub tended between the direction of incident light ray and emergent light fay from a prism is called angle of deviation. 
Refractive index of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in that medium.
The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in a given medium is the refractive index of that medium.
The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in that particular medium.
