{"trg": "What is the acceleration required for a spacecraft to reach the nearest quasar, which is located in the Markarian 231 galaxy, approximately 581 million light years away?", "src": "In space travel, acceleration is critical for achieving escape velocity and accelerating to reach other planets or stars."}
{"trg": "What is the tangential acceleration of a car turning around a circular track with a radius of 100 meters and a speed of 80 km/h?", "src": "Tangential acceleration is the component of acceleration that is perpendicular to the centripetal acceleration and is responsible for changes in the speed of the object."}
{"trg": "What is the minimum radius of a circular track on which a car can safely turn without losing traction, given a speed of 100 km/h and a coefficient of static friction of 0.8?", "src": "Centripetal acceleration is the acceleration of an object moving in a circular path and is always directed towards the center of the circle."}
{"trg": "What is the terminal velocity of a skydiver with a mass of 100 kg and a parachute diameter of 10 meters falling through air?", "src": "Terminal velocity is the maximum speed that an object can reach when falling through a fluid due to air resistance, and occurs when the force of air resistance equals the force of gravity, resulting in zero net acceleration."}
{"trg": "What is the acceleration of a car driving in a circular path with a speed of 30 meters per second and a radius of 500 meters?", "src": "In circular motion, acceleration is directed towards the center of the circle and is given by a = v^2/r, where v is the speed of the object and r is the radius of the circle."}
{"trg": "If a 30 N force is applied to an object with a mass of 3 kg, what is the acceleration of the object?", "src": "Acceleration is closely related to force, as described by Newton's second law: F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration."}
{"trg": "What is the acceleration of a car that goes from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5 seconds?", "src": "The equation for acceleration is a = (v_f - v_i)/t, where v_f is the final velocity, v_i is the initial velocity, and t is the time."}
{"trg": "What is the acceleration of a roller coaster during a corkscrew when it experiences 3 Gs?", "src": "Acceleration can also be expressed in terms of G-forces, where 1 G is equivalent to the acceleration due to gravity."}
{"trg": "What is the acceleration due to gravity on Saturn, where the force of gravity is approximately 1.065 times that of Earth?", "src": "The acceleration due to gravity on Earth is approximately 9.8 m/s^2."}
{"trg": "If an object is accelerating at 5 m/s² and its initial velocity is 10 m/s, what is its final velocity after 6 seconds?", "src": "The SI unit for acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s²)."}
{"trg": "What is the acceleration of a rocket that experiences a sudden change in velocity from 0 m/s to 1000 m/s in 1 second?", "src": "Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time."}
